This repository contains the starter code for the project in [**IBM-CD0285EN-SkillsNetwork DevOps Capstone Project**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-capstone-project?specialization=devops-and-software-engineering) which is part of the [**IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate**](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering)

## Usage

You should use this template to start your DevOps Capstone project. It contains all of the code that you will need to get started.

Do Not fork this code! It is meant to be used by pressing the  <span style=color:white;background:green>**Use this Template**</span> button in GitHub. This will copy the code to your own repository with no connection back to the original repository like a fork would. This is what you want.

## Development Environment

These labs are designed to be executed in the IBM Developer Skills Network Cloud IDE with OpenShift. Please use the links provided in the Coursera Capstone project to access the lab environment.

## Useful commands

Under normal circumstances you should not have to run these commands. They are performed automatically at setup but may be useful when things go wrong:

## Project layout

The code for the microservice is contained in the `service` package. All of the test are in the `tests` folder. The code follows the **Model-View-Controller** pattern with all of the database code and business logic in the model (`models.py`), and all of the RESTful routing on the controller (`routes.py`).

```text
├── service         <- microservice package
│   ├── common/     <- common log and error handlers
│   ├── config.py   <- Flask configuration object
│   ├── models.py   <- code for the persistent model
│   └── routes.py   <- code for the REST API routes
├── setup.cfg       <- tools setup config
└── tests                       <- folder for all of the tests
    ├── factories.py            <- test factories
    ├── test_cli_commands.py    <- CLI tests
    ├── test_models.py          <- model unit tests
    └── test_routes.py          <- route unit tests
```

## Data Model

The Account model contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Optional |
|------|------|----------|
| id | Integer| False |
| name | String(64) | False |
| email | String(64) | False |
| address | String(256) | False |
| phone_number | String(32) | True |
| date_joined | Date | False |

## Your Task

Complete this microservice by implementing REST API's for `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `LIST` while maintaining **95%** code coverage. In true **Test Driven Development** fashion, first write tests for the code you "wish you had", and then write the code to make them pass.

## CD Pipeline

Create on OpenShift Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
```oc create -f tekton/pvc.yaml```

Apply on OC tekton tasks
```oc apply -f tekton/tasks.yaml```

Apply on OC tekton pipeline
```oc apply -f tekton/pipeline.yaml```

Apply to my cluster
```kubectl apply -f tekton/pipeline.yaml```

Start pipeline
```tkn pipeline start cd-pipeline \
    -p repo-url="https://github.com/thelazyj/devops-capstone-project.git" \
    -p branch=main \
    -p build-image=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/$SN_ICR_NAMESPACE/accounts:1 \
    -w name=pipeline-workspace,claimName=pipelinerun-pvc \
    -s pipeline \
    --showlog
```

Monitor Tekton pipeline run
```tkn pipelinerun ls```

Check all deployements with the app accounts
```oc get all -l app=accounts```
